**What Happened Here** is a short adventure horror game: around _30-45 minutes_, exploring the classic horror trope of being locked inside a house and exploring it in order to go out.

> You play as Elly, a 20 year old girl coming back from work one day to find her home completely changed and her roommates nowhere in sight!

> Will you assist her to go out and will you find the truth?

While it’s not needed to play the game, I would appreciate it if you’ll read [Love in The Dark](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW1MS896), a prequel of sorts to What Happened Here
